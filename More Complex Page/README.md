#Bootstrap Page Challenge!

It's time to build a more complex layout! You'll be building [this website](http://getbootstrap.com/). Again, you should not inspect the page with the developer tools. Do not use any css frameworks either, just plain HTML and CSS. If you need to review these languages, this [tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) will be helpful.

##Bonus work

If you find front-end design particularly interesting, then you should learn bootstrap, a responsive-design CSS framework. It's documentation can be found on the website you just emulated. However, you may find a tutorial more helpful.
