# WELCOME TO THE PRECOURSE!!!

## Please Read Everything Before Proceeding...

Welcome To Codesmith Precourse.

The precourse is designed to help you become experience in the fundamental javascript concepts. Much of the challenges may be familiar, especially in the first portion but please be patient since a big end project awaits where you will utilize all your javascript skills to create an "Instagram" clone and a JSON parser in part 2 of the precourse. We aspire you to be proficient in your javascript skills and become a better programmer through the process.

This precourse will truly help you understand the core material and get you ready for our fulltime program. Plus, it is a great opportunity for you to show us that you can handle our rigorous curriculum.

If this is challenging, don't be worrried! Getting used to the challenge will be a great asset to you in our program.

## You Need To Know How To Use GitHub!

By now, you should already know how to use GitHub. If not, make sure you read the ["GitHub.md"](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-JSFundamentals/blob/master/GitHub.md) file to get yourself familiar with the processes. **YOU NEED TO FORK AND CLONE THIS REPO SO READ ["GitHub.md"](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-JSFundamentals/blob/master/GitHub.md) CAREFULLY TO LEARN HOW!**

## Instructions For The Precourse Challenges:

We divided part 2 of the precourse challenges into two sections: instagram and json parser. There are two separate folders for each of the two challenges. During the instagram challenge, you will be creating a basic interface of instagram using HTML/CSS and some Javascript; basically you will be making a clone of instagram. For the json parser challenge, you will be creating a json parser yourself, although it already exists as a javascript method. Please read the "README.md" files inside the two folders for further instructions about each challenge. Be creative with your project and show us that you want to have fun with programming. Good Luck!
