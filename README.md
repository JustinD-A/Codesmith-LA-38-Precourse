# WELCOME TO THE PRECOURSE!!!

## Please Read Everything Before Proceeding...

Welcome To Codesmith Precourse.

The precourse is designed to help you become experienced in the fundamental JavaScript concepts. Much of the challenges may be familiar, especially in the first portion but please be patient since a big end project awaits where you will utilize all your JavaScript skills to build come interesting projects. Part 1 of the precourse is designed to solidify your basics in JavaScript. In part 2 of the precourse, you will be doing more JavaScript challenges while building a copy of the "Google" page and a more complex layout as seen on Twitter's "bootstrap" page. Part 3 of the precourse is equipped with a JSON parser and exposure to JavaScript frameworks. We aspire you to be proficient in your JavaScript skills and become a better programmer through the process.

This precourse will truly help you understand the core material and get you ready for our full time program. Plus, it is a great opportunity for you to show us that you can handle our rigorous curriculum.

If this is challenging, don't be worried! Getting used to the challenge will be a great asset to you in our program.

During the Google page challenge, you will be creating a copy of the "Google" home page using only HTML and CSS. In the fundamentals challenge, you will be working on solidifying your JavaScript skills even further. For the Bootstrap clone challenge, you will be creating a professional layout using only HTML and CSS. Please read the "README.md" files inside the folders for further instructions about each challenge. Be creative with your project and show us that you want to have fun with programming. Good Luck!
