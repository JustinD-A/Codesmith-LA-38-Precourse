# WELCOME TO THE PRECOURSE!!!

## Please Read Everything Before Proceeding...

Welcome To Codesmith Precourse.

The precourse is designed to help you become experience in the fundamental javascript concepts. Much of the challenges may be familiar, especially in the first portion but please be patient since a big end project awaits where you will utilize all your javascript skills to create an "Instagram" clone in part 2 of the precourse. We aspire you to be proficient in your javascript skills and become a better programmer through the process.

This precourse will truly help you understand the core material and get you ready for our fulltime program. Plus, it is a great opportunity for you to show us that you can handle our rigorous curriculum.

If this is challenging, don't be worrried! Getting used to the challenge will be a great asset to you in our program.
