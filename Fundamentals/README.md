# Beginner Level Skill Builder!

## Complete the challenges in ```src/main.js```. To check your answers, open the ```index.html``` file in this directory in your browser.

You will only modify the codes inside the "main.js" file located in the source ("src") folder. **MAKE SURE TO READ ALL COMMENTS** inside the "main.js" file; these will be your instructions for solving each problem. DO NOT CHANGE anything in any other files or folders. You may take a look at the test folder to inquire how we are testing the correctness of the challenges. After you are done with each challenge open the index file (index.html) on the browser (Chrome or Firefox) to display the test results. For incorrect result, a red "x mark" will display beside thine test that did not pass and for correct result, a green "check mark" will display bside the test that passed. We encourage you to look at the displayed error message; it will help you figure out what you might need to fix.

Hopefully you have already read through the skill builders and is equipped with the proper skills to tackle these extensive javascript challenges. But if you still need to brush up your skills, checkout the skill builders again.
